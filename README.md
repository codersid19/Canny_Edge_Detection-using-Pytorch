# Canny Edge Detection using PyTorch

This project focuses on implementing Canny edge detection using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. Canny edge detection is a widely used technique in computer vision for detecting edges in images, which serves as a fundamental step in various image processing tasks.

## Technical Overview

1. **Canny Edge Detection Algorithm:** Canny edge detection is a multi-stage algorithm designed to detect a wide range of edges in images while minimizing noise and false detections. It involves several key steps:
   - **Gaussian Blurring:** Smoothing the image to reduce noise using a Gaussian filter.
   - **Gradient Calculation:** Computing the gradient magnitude and direction of the smoothed image.
   - **Non-maximum Suppression:** Thinning edges to a single-pixel width by suppressing non-maximum pixels along the gradient direction.
   - **Edge Tracking by Hysteresis:** Connecting weak edges to strong edges to form continuous edge contours.
2. **PyTorch Implementation:** The project implements the Canny edge detection algorithm using PyTorch tensors and operations, leveraging PyTorch's computational graph and automatic differentiation capabilities.
3. **Customizable Parameters:** Users can adjust parameters such as the kernel size for Gaussian blurring, threshold values for gradient calculation, and hysteresis thresholding to fine-tune the edge detection process.
4. **Efficient GPU Acceleration:** The implementation efficiently utilizes GPU acceleration provided by PyTorch, enabling fast computation of edge maps for large images or video frames.
